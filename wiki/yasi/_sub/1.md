I’d like to talk about a disagreement I had with my high school classmate, Mark, during a PE class last semester. Mark is a very ==competitive== person, and the conflict happened when our class organized an internal volleyball match.

==The issue was about== team division. Since most of my dormmates were quite skilled at volleyball, Mark wanted to use some clever tactics to group us all into the same team, thinking it would ==guarantee an easy victory==. However, I disagreed with his approach because I believed it would make the game unfair and less enjoyable for others. I insisted on random team assignments to keep the competition balanced.

In the end, the teams were split differently—my dormmates ended up together, while I joined the other team. As I predicted, their team dominated every match effortlessly, but they actually found it boring because there was no real challenge. On the other hand, my team wasn’t as strong, but we fought hard, coordinated well, and even managed to win a few rounds. It turned out to be much more exciting and rewarding.

After class, Mark and I talked about it. He admitted that his initial idea wasn’t the best, and I also understood his desire to win for our dorm’s reputation. We reached a compromise: he agreed not to manipulate team divisions in the future, and I agreed to put in more effort to strive for our dorm’s honor in a fair way.

==Looking back==, <u>I felt this disagreement actually strengthened our friendship.</u> ==It taught me that fairness and sportsmanship matter more than just winning, and open communication can resolve conflicts effectively.==

I’d like to talk about a disagreement I had with my best friend, Lisa, last year. It was about planning a trip together during the summer holiday.

Lisa wanted to go to a beach resort where we could just relax by the sea, sunbathe, and enjoy luxury hotels. However, I preferred an adventurous trip—maybe hiking in the mountains or exploring a new city. I thought lying on the beach all day would be boring, while she argued that hiking would be too tiring for a vacation.

At first, we both insisted on our own ideas and couldn’t reach an agreement. It led to a bit of tension between us, and we even avoided discussing the trip for a few days. Eventually, we decided to compromise: we spent the first half of the trip at a coastal town with a mix of relaxation and water sports, and the second half in a nearby city with cultural sights and light hiking.

In the end, I felt relieved that we resolved the conflict without hurting our friendship. It taught me that disagreements are normal, but communication and flexibility are key to finding a solution. The trip turned out to be amazing because we both got to experience something we enjoyed!
